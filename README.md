# Impacts on Society

The course I teach is called STEM, and I introduce middle schoolers to engineering and computer science through robotics. This document will demonstrate how I plan to incorporate societal impacts of computer science.

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

Students will research and describe a development of computer science through time. Students will evaluate the impacts the development left on society or the influence society had over the development. 

Students will respond to the research other students have done, and organize the impacts collaboratively by comparing and relating the ideas shared in small groups.  

### Learning Activities

Students will be doing in-class research on a chosen topic.  They create a written report of their findings, noting the significant event in computer science, as well as the impact it had on society or vice versa. Students will read their report to a small group of peers, taking turns to share thouhgts on each event. The sutdents will then combine their events into a shared written report, organized chronologically and noting each event's significant impact on society.  This assignment will be done once at the beginning of the semester.

### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.

I plan to use a rubric that checks for accuracy of information, clear articulation on the impact on society, and participation in group discussion and collaboration.

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.

Through this activity, students will discover many significant innovations in computing, as well as the people developing the progress.  Developing an understanding of how computer science fits within society will allow students to more closely relate to the field. As an introductory course, students from a wide range of subpopulations that have been traditionally marginalized in computer science will have an opportunity in it. Since this assignment would happen early in the semester, the class can use it as a frame of reference in analyzing advancements in computer science discovered through out the course.
