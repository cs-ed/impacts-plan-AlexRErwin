# Impacts on Society

The course I teach is called STEM, and I introduce middle schoolers to engineering and computer science through robotics. This document will demonstrate how I plan to incorporate societal impacts of computer science.

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

Students will research and describe a development of computer science through time. Students will evaluate the impacts the development left on society or the influence society had over the development. 

Students will respond to the research other students have done, and organize the impacts collaboratively by comparing and relating the ideas shared in small groups.  

### Learning Activities

Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?

### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
